        <h2 class="title">Conference Calls</h2>
        <h5 class="date">March 23, 2020</h5>
        <p>It's monday, and the first day of our online learning platfrom for Fullstack Web Development. So far, not bad! Runs pretty smooth, I really thought my dirt-tier internet wouldn't be able to keep up but hey, surprise surprise. A conference with 33 other people is slightly manic, but it is what it is. It certainly is nice to be only steps away from food, drinks and a bathroom in the privacy of my own house. I'm still tossing up whether to stay in the city, or go back home to dads to avoid the hysteria that we are experiencing with all this virus nonsense going about. Will report back later.</p>
        <p>I have really kicked into gear on the progress of my portfolio project. I am going for a bit of a minimalist style, but I'm going to try to make it really polished, and nicely responsive for both desktop and mobile devices. Hoping to incorporate a bit of JS for some cool features, we'll see how that goes.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Hungry Snake</h2>
        <h5 class="date">March 22, 2020</h5>
        <p>It's been a few days since the last post, I've decided not to do these every day as quite frankly, life isn't that interesting. Today, however, was very interesting! A huge house clean, a family lunch for my cousins birthday, and feeding my flatmates snake, Charles! I haven't seen a snake fed in person before, but god it was incredible! He's not a terrible large snake, and the size of the rat we fed him was probably 3x thicker than he was. Watching his jaw unhinge and swallow this rat, inches with each gulp, was something to behold. I feel a slightly bad for the rat, but it was already dead so atleast he wasnt a waste.</p>
        <p>I think this snake could be used as proof that no matter how much of a mountain any task appears, if you really commit, you can do seemingly impossible things. Also helps if you can dislocate your jaw in 4 places and turn into what could be considered a living, breathing sock.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Covid-19 and the free days off.</h2>
        <h5 class="date">March 18, 2020</h5>
        <p>So the world's kind of falling apart, that's pretty cool. I should be in class right now but instead I, and all my class-mates, have the rest of the week off to hang out at home, sleep, get baked, or potentially try to do some study. No arguments here, although I do hope it doesn't hurt our momentum in class. I decided to spend the day smoking some mild weed and learning a new programming language, which went great until lunch time, and then I just wanted to binge a new TV show and browse reddit. Did I do it? You'll never know...</p>
        <p>Been thinking of joining up to a bouldering gym as my new form of physical activity. The gym has become too repetitive and I feel like starting to climb would be the perfect mix of problem-solving and exersize. Its proving difficult to find a gym in an appropriate location, but It'll probably be easier to reach when I get my own flat, Ill just have to deal with the commute for now. I shall report back with my verdict whenever I sign up.</p>

        <h2 class="title">This is the first post!</h2>
        <h5 class="date">March 15, 2020</h5>
        <p>Welcome to the first post of my official blog! FULL DISCLAIMER: this is gonna get weird! I'm making this blog for a project at the web development bootcamp I am a part of, Coder Academy! It's not going to be strictly coding related, more just random thoughts that pop into my head and I feel like typing out. Updates on life, exsistential questions, recipes for a good meal, you name it, it might pop up here!</p>
        <p>So far the course has been great, although I am still adjusting to the "city" life. A lot of people, always noisey, I do miss the peace and quiet of home. And the fresh air. But hey, the people are cool, there's plenty to do, and I get to finally be apart of something I love, a team of coders! Hopefully you find some of the content on this blog interesting. If not, look I dont blame you, but its for me not you so who cares!</p>
