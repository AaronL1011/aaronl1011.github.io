        <h2 class="title">Hackathon!</h2>
        <h5 class="date">March 26, 2020</h5>
        <p>Today myself and 2 of my co-horts teamed up in our first ever Ruby hackathon event at Coder Academy.
            The class was given the theme of isolation (appropriate for our current predicament, re: covid-19)
            early in the day, assigned into groups and sent on our way! We brainstormed and landed on the idea
            of a companion application to keep you company during your isolation, lift your spirits, keep you fit,
            and provide updates on the Coronavirus situation.
        </p>
        <p>After smashing out code for hours on end, our team manage to scrape together a fairly functional program!
            I implemented a COVID statistics API and grabbed information about Australias current cases, deaths and
            recoveries, fed it into the program, parsed it from JSON to Ruby and returned it in an easy to read format.
            Once that was functioning correctly I whipped up some dialog, menu prompts/selectors and worked in the modules
            that my team mates created. It was a fun experience, and definitely different from working solo. Overall I think
            a good time was had by all, and the whole class managed to put out some really neat programs.
