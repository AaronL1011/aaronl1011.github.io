## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a visually and technically appealing website to demonstrate my abilities and coding experience.

This portfolio should be responsive and nicely formatted on all devices and include the required content such as:

- Name
- Contact Details
- Links to professional accounts (Github / LinkedIn)
- Work / Study History
- Projects Showcase
- Blog Posts w/ Sample Posts

## Functionality and Features

From the beginning of this project I have had some specific features in mind. I would like the website structure to be fairly minimalist (without compromising on styling) in order to focus the users eye to the more technical aspects (ie. how text responds to the cursor, navigation and fluidity of the website). As my career goal is to be more towards a backend developer, I want to highlight my abilities in getting technical functions and ideas to work properly.

I think a really cool idea to implement is having the ability to switch between a Dark and a Light theme, which is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. I'd like the transitions to be very smooth and appealing to the user, staggering transition times between text, images and backgrounds to add further depth to the website.

I'd also like the bulk of the website to be on one html document. A home screen, projects screen and contact information screens all nagivated by icons on the home screen (and nav menu) which when clicked or tapped, scroll to anchors throughout the page. 

When positioning the Navigation menu, I want to be sure to place it in a region of the screen so mobile users with large devices won't struggle to reach the buttons (which is a pressing issue in this age of large smartphones and small hands).

## Sitemap

The home page, projects and contacts will all be located on the same HTML document. The blog will be its own seperate entity of html files, seperated from the portfolio as a project of its own.

## Target Audience

The target audiences of this project are any potential employers and industry professionals. This is going to be used to display my skills and history to companies that I am applying for jobs with, so I am not overly concerned about the average user not understanding tech jargon or inside-jokes. As long as a recruiter or other developer can appreciate my portfolio website, that will be a win in my books.
